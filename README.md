# Flight Fare Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the fare for flight tickets based on various features like airline, route, duration, and number of stops. Using machine learning, the model learns patterns in historical flight data to provide accurate fare estimates, helping travelers and airlines make informed decisions.

## ✈️ Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw data  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting valuable features (like travel time)  
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Testing multiple models to find the best fit  
- **Visualization:** Gaining insights through plots and graphs

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd flight-fare-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ⚡ Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open and run the `Flight Fare Prediction.ipynb` file step by step.  
3. Adjust input features or test with sample data to see predictions!

Example usage:  
```python
# Example input
airline = 'IndiGo'
source = 'Delhi'
destination = 'Bangalore'
total_stops = 1
journey_day = 24
journey_month = 3
```

Output:  
```
Predicted Fare: ₹ 5,200
```

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Best Model:** [Model Name]  
- **R² Score:** [Value]  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** [Value]  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** [Value]  

*(Replace with actual metrics after model evaluation)*

## 📈 Visual Insights
- Price trends by airline and route  
- Fare distribution over travel durations  
- Impact of stops on ticket prices

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model performance  
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Incorporate time-based factors  
- **Deployment:** Turn into a web app using Flask or Streamlit
